# Conway-Game-of-Life
This is a React-based implementation of John Horton Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation.

## Features 
- Grid is displayed with a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead
- Play, pause, and clear buttons to control the simulation
- Ability to select and place various starting patterns
- Option to randomly generate the initial state of the grid
- Select from a few known patterns and read about them

## Built With 
- React
- Create React App
- CSS
## Acknowledgments
to John Horton Conway for his remarkable invention of the Game of Life. His creation has inspired countless researchers and enthusiasts in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and artificial life. The Game of Life's simple rules have resulted in an incredibly rich and diverse set of behaviors that continue to captivate the minds of many.

**Note:** I created this project for fun and as a learning experience, but I am excited to continue working on it and optimizing it. I have some ideas on how to improve it and I am looking forward to implementing them. Although it's my first react app, I am proud of what I have accomplished and I see a lot of potential for future development.
